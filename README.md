ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Max who goes under the GitHub alias @gratzki

I've recently finished an intense 9 week Le Wagon bootcamp in data by means of career cross-roads since my previous path hit some turbulence due to the global pandemic.
I'm therefore looking at means for finding new challenges that will land a future-proof career path into the tech domain!

ðŸŒ± The data science bootcamp I recently finished provided good insight into the following skillsets:
Data Analytics with SQL, BigQuery, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib; Statistics with Scipy, Seaborn and Statsmodels;Machine Learning with Scikit-learn;
Deep Learning with TensorFlow Keras and develop Data Products with Google Cloud Platform, ML Flow, Flask, Heroku and Streamlit.

ðŸ‘€ I have a variety of interests that specifically revolve around music mainly and travelling. I'm always up for meeting new people and hoping to resolve differences to find
a real connection to help coexist in this very funny world we live in at the moment!

I'm looking to find a working position sooner than later, be it an internship or if lucky a junior position. This will serve as a platform for me to find my confidence in
spreading my digital wings in the data science workspace.

I'm currently based in Stockholm and hope that since it's a real technopolis here I'll find something soon that will open a new solid chapter in my life!
